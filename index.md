## Welcome

Hi, I am **Ankit** and I love to dabble with bits and bytes. 

A founder of an IoT startup based in Bangalore I love to solve build solutions to real-world problems using. My tools of choice are (not necessarily in that order):

- MERN Stack (Webapps),
- ElectronJS (Desktop apps),
- React Native (Mobile apps),
- AWS (Cloud platform) IoT Core, API Gateway, Lambda functions
- IoT/Hardware Devices using ARM Cortex M (STM32, TI-TM4C) & FreeRTOS
- Device-to-cloud connectivity using LoRa, Wifi and Cellular
- KiCAD for PCB/Schematic design

I am currently working on [TaxC](https://github.com/ankitmhn/taxc) which is going to be a self-contained open-source mobile/desktop/web app for simplifying filing GST returns.
